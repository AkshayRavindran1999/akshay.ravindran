## 1. Introduction to Content Delivery Networks (CDN)

A **CDN** is a network of servers distributed around the globe. It stores cached copies of your content, such as images and videos, so that when users request them, the content is delivered from the nearest server — improving speed and reducing latency.

---

## 2. What is CloudFront?

**Amazon CloudFront** is AWS’s content delivery network (CDN) service. It integrates easily with AWS services like S3, EC2, and Lambda@Edge, and is designed to deliver your content with low latency and high speed.

---

## 3. How Does CloudFront Work?

1. User requests an image or file from your site.
2. CloudFront checks its cache:
   - If found → content is delivered immediately.
   - If not → it fetches from your S3 (or other origin), caches it, and delivers.
3. Future requests are served faster via CloudFront's cache.

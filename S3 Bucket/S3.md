# üåê AWS S3 Static Website Hosting Project

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Overview

In this project, we explored the use of **Amazon S3** (Simple Storage Service) to host a static website. Key tasks included creating an S3 bucket, managing permissions, enabling versioning, and configuring static website hosting.

---

## ‚úÖ Steps Performed

### 1. **Created an S3 Bucket**
- Created a new S3 bucket via the AWS Console.
- Used a globally unique bucket name.

![Storage Bucket](image1/sstorage.jpg)

### 2. **Uploaded an HTML File**
- Uploaded a simple `index.html` file as the homepage for the website.

### 3. **Enabled Versioning**
- Enabled **versioning** to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of the uploaded objects.

### 4. **Tested with IAM Users**
- Created different **IAM users** with different permission levels.
- Verified access behavior based on IAM policies.

### 5. **Applied Bucket Policies**

#### üîê Restrict Access to IAM Users Only

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "RestrictBucketToIAMUsersOnly",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowOwnerOnlyAccess",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "aws:PrincipalArn": "arn:aws:iam::AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:root"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
Explanation:
This denies access to everyone except the root user of your AWS account. It ensures only IAM users under your account can access the bucket.



### üåê Public Read Bucket Policy for Website Access

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<Bucket-Name>/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
Explanation:
This allows anyone on the internet to view your files ‚Äî required to make the website publicly accessible.
Only use this if your content is intended to be public.

# ‚úÖ Final Result
## Static website hosted and accessible via the S3 website URL.

## Versioning and IAM access worked as expected.

## Bucket security tested using IAM policies and public access settings.
## We disabled Block public access (bucket settings) .
